        Changing the stress can alter the word‚Äôs meaning. However, the position of stress may shift when additional 
        morphemes are added. For example, the word *economy* changes to *economic*. 

        Another case is when the grammatical category of a word changes, such as when the verb *record* becomes the noun *record*. 
        Additionally, stress may shift in compound words, such as *greenhouse*, which is formed from the words *green* and *house*.""",

        Stress is often indicated by a symbol, such as a single quotation mark before the stressed syllable, 
        boldface type, or both.""",
    
        "[3] Importance of Stress Placement": """Stress placement is crucial for clear English pronunciation. 
        Placing stress on the wrong syllable can confuse listeners and reduce speech intelligibility.
