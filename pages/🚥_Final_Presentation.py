### 1. Know Your Audience: Think Like a Teacher

- Assume your audience is a class of learners, not just classmates.
- Use language that is clear, paced, and appropriate for learners.
- Avoid jargon unless you explain it in simple terms.

---

### 2. Structure Like a Mini Lesson

Follow a basic lesson format:

- **Introduction**: Start with a question, image, or example. State the learning objective.
- **Main Content**: Present one key idea using examples, visuals, or guided explanation.
- **Wrap-Up**: Summarize the main point and ask a reflective question or give a brief check-up.

---

### 3. Practice Teacher Talk

- Speak clearly and confidently with natural pacing.
- Use teaching-friendly expressions like “Let’s look at…”, “Try this…”, or “What do you think?”
- Pause when needed to give the audience time to process.

---

### 4. Use Visual Aids Wisely

- Keep slides simple — they should support your talk, not replace it.
- Use bullet points, key terms, or images. Avoid full paragraphs.
- Make text large and readable.

---

### 5. Manage Your Time

- Practice with a timer and make sure you finish within the limit.
- Focus on teaching one idea clearly rather than covering too many.

---

### 6. Record and Reflect (if possible)

- If you can, record a practice run.
- Check your voice, slide clarity, pacing, and body language.

---

### 7. Think Like a Teacher, Reflect Like a Learner

After your presentation:
- What worked well?
- What would you change if this were a real classroom?
- Did your teaching approach help others understand?

---

### 8. Final Tip: Teach, Don’t Perform

Your job is to help others learn — not just show what you know.  
Focus on clarity, engagement, and learner support.

🌱 **Remember**: when you present, you are using your audience’s learning time.  
It is your responsibility to make your message clear, useful, and **worth listening to.**
