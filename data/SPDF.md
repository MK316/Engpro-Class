### [Verse 1]
Michael Rennie was <span style="color:red">**ill**</span>   
the day the earth stood <span style="color:red">**still**</span>   
But he told us where we stand   

And Flash Gordon was <span style="color:red">**there**</span>    
in silver <span style="color:red">**underwear**</span>   
Claude Rains was the invisible man   

Then something went <span style="color:red">**wrong**</span>    
for Fay Wray and King <span style="color:red">**Kong**</span>   
They got caught in a celluloid jam   

Then at a deadly pace it came from outer space   
And this is how the message ran   

### [Chorus]
Science Fiction, Double <span style="color:red">**Feature**</span>   
Dr. X will build a <span style="color:red">**creature**</span>   
See androids fighting Brad and <span style="color:red">**Janet**</span>   
Anne Francis stars in Forbidden <span style="color:red">**Planet**</span>   
Wa-ah-ah-oh-oh   
At the late night, double feature picture show     

### [Verse 2]
I knew Leo G. Carroll was over a barrel   
When Tarantula took to the **hills**   
And I really got hot when I saw Janette Scott   
Fight a Triffid that spits poison and **kills**   
Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the runes   
And passing them used lots of **skills**   
But "When worlds collide," said George Pal to his bride   
"I'm going to give you some terrible **thrills**"
