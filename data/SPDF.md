# Lyrics of Science Picture, Double Feature (The Rocky Horror Show)

+ 1975 movie
+ [Movie info](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/)

### [Verse 1]
Michael Rennie was **ill**
the day the earth stood **still**
But he told us where we stand

And Flash Gordon was **there** 
in silver **underwear**
Claude Rains was the invisible man

Then something went **wrong** 
for Fay Wray and King **Kong**
They got caught in a celluloid jam

Then at a deadly pace it came from outer space
And this is how the message ran

### [Chorus]
Science Fiction, Double **Feature**
Dr. X will build a **creature**
See androids fighting Brad and **Janet**
Anne Francis stars in Forbidden **Planet**
Wa-ah-ah-oh-oh
At the late night, double feature picture show

### [Verse 2]
I knew Leo G. Carroll was over a barrel
When Tarantula took to the **hills**
And I really got hot when I saw Janette Scott
Fight a Triffid that spits poison and **kills**
Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the runes
And passing them used lots of **skills**
But "When worlds collide," said George Pal to his bride
"I'm going to give you some terrible **thrills**"
